//We are going to build a small TypeScript program that describes a mini online shop. The goal is to represent a customer, their shopping cart, and calculate the total price. 
 
// Steps 
// 1.Create an interface Product with the following fields: 
// name: string  
// price: number  
// category: "food" | "clothes" | "electronics" 
// 2.Create a type Category with the possible categories (food, clothes, electronics) 
// 3.Create an interface Customer with the following fields: 
// name: string   
// email: string 
// cart: Product[] — an array containing the products in the customer’s cart 
// 4. Create two example products (e.g., an apple and a T-shirt). 
// 5. Create one customer who has both products
